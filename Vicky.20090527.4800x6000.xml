<!--
  PARAMETERS:

  resultFileName - name and location of the file where result will be saved
  originalFileName - name of the file which you want to be base for the mosaic
  picturesDirectory - directory where all little pictures are stored (those picture will be used for mosaic)
  numberOfPictures - how many pictures should be on the diagnal - the more the smaller pictures will be but the resulting image will be better
  minimumDistanceOfRepetitions - if small picture repeats itself - what is the minimum distance between repetitions
  scale - how many times the result mosaic widht and hight should be bigger then the original
  speed - how much faster (less acurate) should the algorithm work; 1: compare every pixel, 2 compare average of squares 2x2, etc
  morphFactor - final touch, how many percent should the image be morhed into original; 0: no morphing, 0.25: - 25% morphing (recommended), 1: 100% - will look like resized original
  logFile - where to log progress; ommit this attribute for no logging, leave it empty "" for screen, or specify filename

  BEST RESULTS ADVICE:

  Here is an example of settings which I have found to work very good for my needs.
  You can try those settings and then play with changing different parameters to get the effect you need.

  Print size (I recommend to use photo lab to print final mosaic): 		10 x 8
  Print PPI (or DPI): 								300
  Aspect ratio (standard for computer screen and digital camera pictures): 	.75 
  Final print size in pixels:							3000 x 2250
  Final print size in inches:							10 x 7.5

  Number of small pictures on diagnal:						50
  Total number of small pictures:						50 * 50 = 2500
  Size of small picture in pixels						60 x 45
  Size of small picture in inches						0.20 x 0.15

  Size of original:								1024 x 768
  Scale:									2250 / 768 = 3000 / 1024 = 2.9296875
  Speed (the average of 5x5 square gives 12 x 9 points of comparison):		5
  Morph Factor (more will blure the little pictures, less won't have effect): 	0.25

  TO INCREASE SPEED OF GENERATING MOSAIC, RESIZE ALL PICTURES TO FINAL RESOLUTION
  REMEMBER TO SAVE ORIGINALS - DO NOT OVERWRITE ORIGINALS
